3. Namesty added `load_wrapper` to the Client trait, enhancing functionality and increasing usability for users. (2023-05-07)

CI/CD

3. Jure Bogunovic added a new test to the `test_env_with_invoke.rs` file (`test_env_can_be_registered_for_any_uri_in_resolution_path()`), but it's commented out as it requires further implementation. (2023-05-10)

4. Namesty fixed an issue with encoding empty arguments in the Rust client for Polywrap, by modifying the `wrapper.rs` and `wasm_wrapper.rs` files and adding the `polywrap_msgpack::msgpack()` function. (2023-05-05)
