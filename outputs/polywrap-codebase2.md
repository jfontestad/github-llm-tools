-> **Question**: Give me an overview of the polywrap python client. What are its capabilities? 

**Answer**: The Polywrap Python Client is a developer tool that allows for easy integration of Web3 protocols into any application. It enables the execution of WebAssembly Polywrappers on a Python environment, regardless of what language the wrapper was built in. The client is built following the functionality of the JavaScript Polywrap Client and currently supports MVP features. In the future, the Polywrap DAO plans to improve the Python capabilities to reach feature parity with the JS stack and build clients for other languages like Go and Rust. The Python implementation includes all fundamental types and algorithms of the WRAP standard. The Polywrap project is completely open-source, and contributors of all levels are welcome. Detailed information about Polywrap and the WRAP standard can be found in their developer documentation. 

-> **Question**: Can you make a polywrap python calculator wrapper? 

**Answer**: The Polywrap Python Client is a developer tool that allows easy integration of Web3 protocols into any application, enabling applications on any platform, written in any language, to read and write data to Web3 protocols. The MVP Python client allows the execution of WebAssembly Polywrappers on a Python environment, regardless of what language this wrapper was built in. The client is built following the functionality of the JavaScript Polywrap Client, which is currently more robust and battle tested, as it has additional capabilities than this MVP. Future improvements are planned to reach feature parity with the JS stack, while building in parallel clients for other languages like Go and Rust. 

-> **Question**: How can I call a wrapper with the polywrap python client? 

**Answer**: To call a wrapper using the Polywrap Python Client, you need to create a file in the `TODO (?polywrap-client)` directory, import the `PolywrapClient`, call the `Uri` where the WASM wrapper is hosted, and specify any required `arguments`. Here is an example which takes in a message as a string and returns it:

```python
# hello_world.py
from polywrap_client import PolywrapClient
from polywrap_core import Uri, InvokerOptions

args = {"arg": "hello polywrap"}
options = InvokerOptions(
    uri=Uri.from_str("ens/wrapper.eth"),
    method="simpleMethod",
    args=args,
    encode_result=False,
)

client = PolywrapClient()
result = await client.invoke(options)
```

You can also check the Polywrap Python Client documentation for more information on how to configure and instantiate the client, as well as how to invoke a wrapper.
