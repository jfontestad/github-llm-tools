Once the Polywrap JS client has been installed, the next step is to create a `PolywrapClient` instance:

```typescript
$snippet: js-create-client-instance
```

At this point, you can already invoke wrappers. In the simple example below, we send one to the "hello world" wrapper.

```typescript
$snippet: js-client-hello-world
```
