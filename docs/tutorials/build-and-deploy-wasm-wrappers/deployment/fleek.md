### What is Fleek?
Fleek is the easiest way to build, deploy, and host websites & apps on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/)
 Fleek provides one seamless workflow with everything you need to build fast, modern sites & web apps hosted on IPFS.


### What you need to get started:
* We'll be using the [Polywrap Demos](https://github.com/polywrap/demos) repo for this guide. 
* 💚 [Node. js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 
* ⚡ [Fleek](https://fleek.co/)
* 🐳 [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* 🧶[Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/)
    * Versions:  `node >=10.0.0` or `yarn >=1.0.0`
* 🔸 [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)


### Step 1. Clone the polywrap demo project  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/polywrap/demos.git
```

### Step 2. Git pull metadata
Then, we will check out the demo branch with the metafiles already set up:

```bash
git pull origin polywrap-metadata
```

### Step 3. Build the wrapper
Now, we can build the sample wrapper with the following commands:

```bash
nvm use
yarn
yarn build
```

Your `build` folder should be generated now. Copy and paste the `./polywrap.meta.yaml` and `./meta` files into the `build` folder.

### Step 4.  **Upload the build folder to Fleek**

Make sure you signup for a Fleek account. 

* On the left-hand side menu of your `Fleek.` 
* Account page, click on the `"Storage"` link.

* Then, click `"Create Folder"`

Example: `Gm-Polywrap`

* Click `Confirm` to create the folder 

![Fleek Step 3](../../../../static/img/docs/tutorials/build-and-deploy-wasm-wrappers/deployment/fleek/fleek-step-3.png)

* Click the Folder 
* After that, click `"Upload"`

* Select the contents of your `build` folder onto `Fleek.`

* Click `Confirm.`

:::tip
Due to the current Filecoin deal size limitation, files are batched together across Fleek products and uploaded as one Filecoin

So it might take 24-48 hours, depending on Fleek usage, for content to appear in ipfs

### Step 5.  **Verifying the package on IPFS**

Click the   `"Verify on IPFS"`   button. 

You will get an IPFS hash! 

For an example of what you should see, visit this [IPFS link](https://ipfs.fleek.co/ipfs/QmQLsx7sxkLrXwh8dPmF2MTWJmgB5C2FmWYth11i7oL3vN).


Now that you have the IPFS hash, you can use it as a value in the URI property of your Polywrap queries to access the functions in this wrapper. 

You can also register an ENS domain and have it resolved to this IPFS content.

 🎉 Congratulations 🎉 on deploying to Fleek!
