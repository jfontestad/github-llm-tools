A Client is any library that supports to the [WRAP Standard](https://github.com/polywrap/specification/blob/main/standards/00_WRAP.md).

Essentially, any library that can resolve and invoke [Wraps](./wraps) is a Client.

The Polywrap Foundation maintains a number of WRAP-compatible clients, most notably:

- [Polywrap JS Client](https://github.com/polywrap/toolchain/tree/origin-0.10/packages/js/client)
- [Polywrap Python Client](https://github.com/polywrap/python-client)
- [Polywrap Rust Client](https://github.com/polywrap/rust-client)

Other WRAP-compatible clients:
- [Polywrap Go Client](https://github.com/polywrap/go-client)

More clients are in development, such as a Polywrap Swift Client (more soon).
