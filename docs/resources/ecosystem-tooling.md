Check out the amazing projects Polywrap DAO contributors have made:

* [Ethereum ABI -> Wrapper Generator](https://github.com/nerfZael/abi-to-wrap): is a node.js console app that can read an Ethereum smart contract abi file and generate Polywrap wrapper code for schema and AssemblyScript modules..
* [`Defiwrapper`](https://github.com/defiwrapper/defiwrapper) is a collection of different DeFi related wrappers like defi-sdk, coingecko, etc. With Defiwrapper, the ambition is to create a cross-chain multi-platform suite of DeFi related wrappers.
