# [Work in Progress] Langchain Demos

Welcome to Langchain Demos! This project showcases example use-cases of the LLMS framework to create practical tools such as a documentation chatbot, a codebase analyzer, and a GitHub repository status reporter. 

Managing an open-source repository with hundreds of collaborators can be a daunting task due to the abundance of communication and accumulation of tribal knowledge. To alleviate this problem, we have created a bot that examines the most recent Pull Requests (PRs) and commits from a repository. It subsequently produces a comprehensive summary and newsletter, making the collaboration process smoother and more efficient.

Check out a sample of our generated newsletter [here](https://lnkd.in/e4cnVPan) and the source code [here](https://lnkd.in/emRFhicY).

## Demonstrations

### Polywrap 
- Codebase.ipynb: This is a chatbot that is programmed with the knowledge of a GitHub repository's codebase.

### AutoGPT
- DocsChat.ipynb: This chatbot has been trained on the .md documentation files in the /docs folder of a GitHub repository.

Visit the [outputs](./outputs/) directory to explore all the files that our tools can generate.
